This means you can take soil from each land parcel and combine it into a single sample to test the SOM. If you need to take soil samples on areas within a land parcel containing historic or archaeological features, including scheduled monuments, you must follow the requirements explained in section 5.6: ‘Land with historic or archaeological features’ of the SFI scheme guidance. To help improve national data on the condition of England’s soils, Defra or the RPA may ask you to provide some information about your soil assessment and SOM testing results during this action’s 3-year duration. This data is one of the public goods that this action is paying for and part of wider government measures in relation to our soils policy and strategy. We’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about what information is needed and how to supply it. For the soil assessment and soil management plan, you must: For the SOM testing, each year of this action’s 3-year duration you must: If the timing meets the requirements above, you can do the SOM testing at the same time as your other routine soil testing required in the farming rules for water. If you enter land into this action which has not been tested for SOM within the last 5 years, you should try to do the SOM testing on that land during the first 12 months of your SFI agreement.

You can do the following actions or options on the same area in a land parcel as this action. Some actions or options can only be done on the same area if they’re done at a different time of year to this action. For example, winter cover followed by a summer companion crop. Read ‘What to do’ and ‘When to do it’ to find out when this action must be done. If an action or option cannot be located on the same area, you may be able to do it on a different area in the same land parcel.

You must: You can use the following to get paid for this action: To test the SOM for small land parcels, you can combine them into a single sample area if the soil type and past management is similar. This means you can take soil from each land parcel and combine it into a single sample to test the SOM. If you need to take soil samples on areas within a land parcel containing historic or archaeological features, including scheduled monuments, you must follow the requirements explained in section 5.6: ‘Land with historic or archaeological features’ of the SFI scheme guidance.

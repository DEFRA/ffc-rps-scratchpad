    "In order to compute available area for a given action we need to be able to assess compatibility between existing actions on a parcel and the applicant action. To do this we must construct a compatibility matrix, for which we must scrape each action's page and extract the compatible actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "- use the action-scraper.ipynb notebiook to construct a list of the urls of all the actions\n",
    "- write a new function to extratc only the compatible actions\n",
    "- run that over the list of actions, storing compatible actions in the values array of a dict of actions\n",
    "- write an algo that reads in this dict and outputs a compat matrix - we may need to derive a class in which to store the matrix, or some JSON-serialisable form we can read in and parse for the JS peeps"

As software and data engineers in the Future RPS team we would like some (psudonymised) examples of land parcel data. We are primarily interested in Land Parcel IDs and associated polygons (and/or geoJSON as appropriate), the land cover associated with those land parcels and which actions schemes have been agreed to on those land parcels. If it's possible to include land use then that would also be welcome, but not essential.

We are more interested in the schema than accuracy so a relatively small number of records (100s) will suffice, and our timescales are short so we would prefer less accurae data in a shorter timescale, if that's a consideration.

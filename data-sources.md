# Data Sources

The following came from a chat with Paul Brotherton (PB), James Peacock (JP) and Ian Shell Macleod (ISM). We wanted to know where data may come from for the rules engine to operate.

## TL:DR

For the demo, we will request a dataset from RPA [here](https://defragroup.service-now.com/esc?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=707b46a21b39f150848b8594e34bcbe3). This should have everything we need. The following shows sources of data in the current landscape.

## Land parcels

Parcel boundaries are in LMS

PB can help to obtain sample data from LMS

SitiAgri masters the land parcel ids and adds the mapping to SBI (Business Id), it is possible to obtain these.

## Land features

LMS has over 120 layers of feature data + hedges.

JP has a data catalog for these.

## Land cover

LMS

## Action, scheme etc -> land parcel mapping

SitiAgri + Genisys (Environmental Stewardship Scheme)

LMS deals in geodata, SitiAgri turns this into land parcel id -> x info mapping

## Land use

SitiAgri
